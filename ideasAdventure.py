#Ideas
#Save and Respawn System------>
#->Respawn system: when die half of your items at random get delted and you get sent to your last save
#Save system: you can save almost any time except for when in dungeons and fighting bosses.
#When you save: all your items, achievments, story level, and everything else is saved to that spot
#when you die you get sent back to that time and all those items get uploaded to your lists 
#when save again items get overiden with new stuff
#Attack Monster and monsterAttack----->
#Make it so either you role a die and item damage or onster dmaage get added
#Or make it so you roll a dice the amount of max damage for creatures or items
#makes fights longer and more intresting and chance to miss shots, unique when shooting to 
#have lower shot chance depending on distance.
#Boss Fights----->
#Make it so when you are fighting boss you get sent to location with certain size.
#Can move around and boss tries to kill you after every movement or attack
#This works when you use bow and stuff
#Fighting envirement has boundries and stuff [boundries] and cant go past them
#
#
#(TO DO) Make an unequip feature - super easy. Also make a tell me how much damage feature
#Or do that when call item info
